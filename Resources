Yes, finding a single, free textbook that covers cyber forensics specifically for the Australian environment is difficult, as most resources are US-centric.

The best approach is to combine a high-quality, general-purpose free textbook with specific Australian government and legal resources.

## Foundational Cyber Forensics Textbooks (Free)
These resources are excellent for learning the core technical principles of digital forensics, which are universal.

**Digital Forensics Laboratory Manual** (University of New Haven)
This is a fantastic, hands-on lab manual that provides students with practical exercises. It covers fundamental topics like evidence handling, file system analysis (FAT, NTFS), and registry forensics using open-source tools. While it doesn't cover Australian law, it's perfect for the hands-on, technical component of a course.

**NIST Special Publications**
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the industry-standard guides for digital forensics procedures. These are not narrative textbooks but are essential, authoritative references.
* **SP 800-86: Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response:** Covers the forensic process from a cybersecurity incident perspective.
* **SP 800-101: Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics:** Provides a detailed framework for handling and analyzing mobile devices.

## Australian Legal & Procedural Context (Free)
You'll need to supplement the technical knowledge from the books above with these Australian-specific resources to cover legal and procedural requirements.

**The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC)**
The AIC publishes numerous reports, trends, and statistical bulletins on cybercrime in Australia. These papers are invaluable for understanding the local threat landscape and the Australian response to cybercrime.

**Key Legislation on AustLII**
Students must have a foundational understanding of the laws governing digital evidence. The Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII) provides free access to all legislation. Key acts include:
* **Evidence Act 1995 (Cth):** Particularly sections on the admissibility of electronic documents and evidence.
* **Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (TIA Act):** Governs law enforcement access to metadata and communications content.
* **Surveillance Devices Act 2004 (Cth):** Regulates the use of surveillance devices by law enforcement.

**Office of the eSafety Commissioner**
While focused on online safety, the eSafety Commissioner's office publishes research and reports that are highly relevant to investigations involving online harassment, image-based abuse, and other forms of cybercrime prevalent in Australia.

By combining the practical labs from the UNH manual with the procedural rigour of NIST guides and the essential legal context from Australian government sources, you can create a comprehensive and locally relevant curriculum for your students.

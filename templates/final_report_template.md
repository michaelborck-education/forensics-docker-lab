- [x] Email_Logs (Communication analysis)
- [x] Network_Analysis (Network traffic)

### Methodology

**Analysis Approach**:
1. [First analysis phase and tools used]
2. [Second analysis phase and tools used]
3. [Third analysis phase and tools used]
4. [Correlation phaseâ€”how evidence was cross-referenced]

**Tools Used**:
- [Tool]: [Version] - [Purpose in analysis]
- [Tool]: [Version] - [Purpose in analysis]
- [Tool]: [Version] - [Purpose in analysis]

**Chain of Custody**:
- All evidence maintained according to forensic standards
- Hash verification performed at each stage
- Analysis logs documented in analysis_log.csv for each lab
- Chain of custody records maintained throughout investigation

## Timeline of Events

**Build a unified timeline combining evidence from all sources.**

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event | Evidence Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2009-XX-XX HH:MM:SS | [Event description] | [USB disk / Memory / Network / Email] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| 2009-XX-XX HH:MM:SS | [Event description] | [USB disk / Memory / Network / Email] | [High/Medium/Low] |
| 2009-XX-XX HH:MM:SS | [Event description] | [USB disk / Memory / Network / Email] | [High/Medium/Low] |

**Narrative Timeline**:

[Write as a chronological story of the incident. Format like: "At approximately HH:MM on DATE, network traffic shows... Shortly after, memory analysis reveals... File metadata suggests... By the time of imaging, disk forensics confirm..."]

---

## Evidence Synthesis and Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Compromise

**Network Evidence**:
- [DNS queries, suspicious connections, timing]
- Inferred entry point or attack vector

**Disk Evidence**:
- [Files created, processes executed, evidence of compromise]

**Memory Evidence**:
- [Processes running at time of dump, network connections from memory]

**Supporting Analysis**:
[How do all three align? What does this tell us about how the system was compromised?]

---

### Phase 2: Persistence and Lateral Movement

**Evidence**:
- [Disk artifacts showing persistence mechanisms]
- [Memory evidence of running malware]
- [Network connections indicating C2 activity]
- [Email communications coordinating activity]

**Supporting Analysis**:
[Narrative of how attacker maintained access and moved through systems]

---

### Phase 3: Data Exfiltration

**Evidence**:
- [Files accessed/modified, USB activity]
- [Memory evidence of encryption tools or staging areas]
- [Network transfers showing large data volumes]
- [Email communications with external recipients]

**Supporting Analysis**:
[Evidence that data was intentionally stolen vs. incidental access. How much data? Where did it go?]

---

### Phase 4: Covering Tracks

**Evidence**:
- [Log deletion or modification]
- [File timestamp manipulation]
- [Memory-resident tools used to hide activity]

**Supporting Analysis**:
[Did attacker attempt anti-forensics? What evidence remains despite attempts to hide?]

---

## Forensic Conclusions

### Key Findings

**Finding 1: [Descriptive title]**
- Evidence: [Disk artifact + Memory evidence + Network evidence + Email evidence]
- Conclusion: [What this proves]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low - based on corroborating evidence]
- Forensic Significance: [What this means for the case]

**Finding 2: [Descriptive title]**
- Evidence: [Combined evidence from multiple sources]
- Conclusion: [What this proves]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
- Forensic Significance: [What this means]

[Continue for each major finding]

### Answers to Key Questions

**"How did the attacker get in?"**
[Answer based on network and disk evidence]

**"What was the attacker's goal?"**
[Answer based on file access, exfiltration, and email evidence]

**"How long were they in the system?"**
[Answer based on timeline evidence]

**"What evidence remains?"**
[Answer based on what forensics found despite cleanup attempts]

## Recommendations and Remediation

### Immediate Actions

1. [Action to prevent further compromise]
2. [Action to limit damage]
3. [Action to gather additional evidence]

### Short-Term Remediation

1. [Technical remediation - patching, isolation, etc.]
2. [Access control changes - reset passwords, revoke certificates]
3. [Monitoring - what should be watched going forward?]

### Long-Term Prevention

1. [Architectural changes to prevent this type of attack]
2. [Process improvements - incident response, detection]
3. [Training and awareness for staff]

---

## Limitations and Gaps

### Evidence Limitations

- What evidence couldn't be recovered? (e.g., logs were deleted, encryption prevented analysis)
- What evidence is ambiguous or incomplete?
- What system states are unknown? (e.g., what happened before imaging?)

### Analytical Gaps

- What couldn't be determined from available tools?
- What would require additional investigation?
- Are there alternative explanations for any findings?

### Forensic Caveats

- This analysis is based on forensic images captured at a point in time
- Encrypted evidence and live-only artifacts may not be recoverable
- Some timestamps and sequencing rely on inference from available evidence
- Future incident response should capture additional evidence sources (logs, network captures, memory dumps at multiple times)

## Key Principles for Strong Reporting

1. **Objectivity**: Report facts, not speculation. Clearly distinguish between known and inferred.
2. **Corroboration**: Important findings should be supported by evidence from multiple sources.
3. **Methodology**: Explain how you reached conclusions so others can verify your work.
4. **Significance**: For each finding, explain what it means forensically and for the case.
5. **Completeness**: Address what you know, what you don't know, and what you can't know from available evidence.
6. **Professional Quality**: This report may be read by lawyers, judges, or company leadershipâ€”formatting and clarity matter.

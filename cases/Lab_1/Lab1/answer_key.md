# Answer Key (Instructor Reference)

- Expected recovered file: `flag.txt` containing the string `secret`.
- `tsk_recover` should place outputs under `cases/Lab1/tsk_recover_out/`.
- `foremost` may recover additional file fragments depending on signatures.
- Timeline should show creation and deletion of `flag.txt` around the time the script ran.
- Accept variations as long as commands and reasoning are sound.

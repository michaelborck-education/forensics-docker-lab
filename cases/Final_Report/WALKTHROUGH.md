# Final_Report Lab - Student Walkthrough
## Case Consolidation & Professional Report

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tools:** Text editor, spreadsheet application, all previous labs

---

## üéØ Mission

Synthesize findings from all 5 labs (USB_Imaging, Memory_Forensics, Autopsy_GUI, Email_Logs, Network_Analysis) into a unified, professional investigation report. This is where individual artifacts become a coherent narrative proving guilt or innocence.

---

## üìã Pre-Lab Setup

This lab does NOT use the forensic workstation. You'll work on your **host machine** consolidating evidence.

### 1. Verify Final_Report Templates Are Ready

The lab folder should already contain template files. Verify they exist:

```bash
# On your host machine
ls -lh cases/Final_Report/
```

You should see:
- **chain_of_custody.csv** - Evidence handling record (from all labs)
- **analysis_log.csv** - Master command log (optional for consolidation)
- **lab_report.md** - Available if alternative format needed
- **final_report.md** - Report template for comprehensive incident synthesis (PRIMARY)
- **WALKTHROUGH.md** - This document

**What each file does:**

| File | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **chain_of_custody.csv** | Master evidence record from all 5 labs | Before starting - consolidate all evidence hashes |
| **analysis_log.csv** | Optional master log if tracking all commands | During lab - optional for tracking consolidated analysis |
| **final_report.md** | Template for comprehensive incident investigation | Main deliverable - synthesize all evidence into narrative |
| **lab_report.md** | Alternative format if needed | Optional - individual lab-style reporting |

If any files are missing, copy them from templates/:

```bash
# Copy missing templates (if needed)
cp templates/chain_of_custody.csv cases/Final_Report/chain_of_custody.csv
cp templates/analysis_log.csv cases/Final_Report/analysis_log.csv
cp templates/lab_report_template.md cases/Final_Report/lab_report.md
cp templates/final_report_template.md cases/Final_Report/final_report.md
```

**Tips for using these files:**
- **chain_of_custody.csv**: Consolidate evidence records from all 5 lab folders. This becomes your master evidence list.
- **final_report.md**: Use this as your primary template. It's designed for synthesizing evidence from multiple sources into a unified incident narrative.
- **lab_report.md**: Available if you prefer the individual lab format instead of the comprehensive final report format.

### 2. Review All Previous Labs

Open these folders and review all findings and evidence:
```bash
cases/USB_Imaging/        # Files, deleted items, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Memory_Forensics/   # Processes, network connections, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Autopsy_GUI/        # Timeline, artifacts, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Email_Logs/         # Communications, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Network_Analysis/   # Traffic, exfiltration, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
```

**Key documents to review:**
- Each lab's `lab_report.md` for analysis and findings
- Each lab's `chain_of_custody.csv` for evidence details and hashes
- Each lab's `analysis_log.csv` for methodology transparency

---

## üìä Part 1: Consolidate Chain of Custody

Combine hashes from all 5 labs into a master file.

**Open these files:**
- cases/USB_Imaging/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Memory_Forensics/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Autopsy_GUI/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Email_Logs/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Network_Analysis/chain_of_custody.csv

**In cases/Final_Report/master_chain_of_custody.csv:**
Add one row for EACH evidence item with:
- Evidence_ID: USB-001, MEMORY-001, EMAIL-001, etc.
- Date_Received: (when seized)
- MD5_Hash: (from each lab)
- SHA256_Hash: (from each lab)
- Analyst_Name: (your name)
- Evidence_Description: Brief description

**Example row:**
```
USB-001,2024-10-20,14:00:00,Field Agent,fc8096...,6ebe35...,Michael,CASE-2024-001,"16GB SanDisk USB (usb.img)",./cases/secure_evidence/
```

---

## üìù Part 2: Consolidate Analysis Log

Combine all commands run across all 5 labs.

**Open these files:**
- cases/USB_Imaging/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Memory_Forensics/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Autopsy_GUI/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Email_Logs/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Network_Analysis/analysis_log.csv

**In cases/Final_Report/master_analysis_log.csv:**
Copy all rows from each lab's analysis_log.csv in chronological order.

**Sort by timestamp_utc** to create a complete timeline of analysis activities.

---

## üîç Part 3: Build Master Timeline

Create a comprehensive timeline showing WHEN attacks happened.

**File:** cases/Final_Report/MASTER_TIMELINE.txt

```
CLOUDCORE INCIDENT TIMELINE
Case: CLOUDCORE-2024-INS-001

=== PHASE 1: PREPARATION ===
[Date/Time from Lab 1] - Files created on USB
- Evidence: [from USB_Imaging file list]
- Suspicious files: [project_secrets.zip, client_database.csv, etc.]
- Timestamp correlation: [were these created same day?]

=== PHASE 2: ENCRYPTION/STAGING ===
[Date/Time from Lab 2] - Memory dump captured
- TrueCrypt.exe running: [yes/no, PID]
- Network connections: [IRC port 6667?, external IPs?]
- Timestamp: [when was memory dumped?]
- Indicates: [suspect was encrypting/preparing data]

=== PHASE 3: COMMUNICATION ===
[Date/Time from Lab 4] - Emails sent
- Recipients: [external email addresses]
- Subject: [what was said?]
- Attachments: [file names, sizes]
- When: [specific timestamps]
- Indicates: [suspect communicating with accomplice]

=== PHASE 4: EXFILTRATION ===
[Date/Time from Lab 5] - Network traffic
- IRC C2 commands received: [yes/no]
- Large data transfer detected: [size, destination]
- Duration: [how long did transfer take?]
- When: [specific timestamp]
- Indicates: [data being stolen over network]

=== PHASE 5: CLEANUP ===
[Date/Time from Lab 1] - Files deleted
- Deleted files: [list what was deleted]
- When: [after exfiltration?]
- Indicates: [suspect covering tracks]

=== CONCLUSION ===
Timeline shows coordinated, planned attack:

2. Load into memory
3. Encrypt with TrueCrypt
4. Email to accomplice
5. Exfiltrate over network
6. Delete traces
Total duration: [X hours/days]
```

## üîó Part 4: Create Evidence Correlation Matrix

Show how findings from different labs support each other.

**File:** cases/Final_Report/CORRELATION_MATRIX.txt

```
EVIDENCE CORRELATION MATRIX

Finding: "project_secrets.zip" file
- Lab 1: Found in recovered files (inode 257)
- Lab 1: File deleted (marked with *)
- Lab 4: Referenced in email subject line
- Lab 5: Large transfer (50MB) to external server
‚Üí CONCLUSION: Same file from USB ‚Üí emailed ‚Üí exfiltrated

Finding: TrueCrypt process
- Lab 2: TrueCrypt.exe running (PID 2048)
- Lab 2: Network connections from PID 2048 to 8.8.8.8:6667
- Lab 1: encrypted_container.dat found on USB
‚Üí CONCLUSION: Suspect used TrueCrypt to encrypt stolen data

Finding: IRC C2 Communication
- Lab 2: Memory shows connection to port 6667
- Lab 5: Network capture shows IRC traffic
- Lab 5: Commands visible in pcap (if readable)
‚Üí CONCLUSION: Malware or direct attacker control via IRC

STRONG CORRELATIONS = PLANNED, COORDINATED ATTACK
```

## üéØ Part 8: Reflect on Investigation Process

**File:** cases/Final_Report/PROCESS_REFLECTION.txt

Questions to answer:

1. **What evidence was MOST important?**
   - Which single piece of evidence proved guilt?
   - Why was that more important than others?

2. **What did each lab contribute?**
   - Could we have solved it with just Lab 1? Lab 2?
   - Why was having all 5 labs necessary?

3. **What challenges did you face?**
   - Command syntax errors?
   - Evidence interpretation?
   - Thinking like an attacker?

4. **What would you do differently?**
   - Better search keywords?
   - Different tools?
   - Different analysis order?

5. **How confident in your conclusion?**
   - Strong (multiple corroborating sources)
   - Moderate (some gaps)
   - Weak (inconclusive)
   - Why?

## üìö Summary

This lab brings all 5 previous investigations together into a unified case narrative. Your report should answer:

**THE 5 W's + H:**
- **WHO** committed the crime?
- **WHAT** did they do?
- **WHEN** did it happen? (timeline)
- **WHERE** did evidence go?
- **WHY** did they do it? (motive, if evident)
- **HOW** did they carry it out? (method)

If your report answers all 6 questions with supporting evidence, you've written a complete forensic investigation!

---

**Congratulations on completing all 6 labs!**

You've now experienced a complete forensic investigation from evidence collection through professional reporting. This is what real-world digital forensics looks like.

Remember: **Documentation is Evidence. Evidence is Truth.**

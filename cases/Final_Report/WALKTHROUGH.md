# Final_Report Lab - Student Walkthrough
## Case Consolidation & Professional Report

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 hours

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Tools:** Text editor, spreadsheet application, all previous labs

---

## üéØ Mission

Synthesize findings from all 4 labs (USB_Imaging, Memory_Forensics, Email_Logs, Network_Analysis) into a unified, professional investigation report. This is where individual artifacts become a coherent narrative proving guilt or innocence.

---

## üìã Pre-Lab Setup

This lab does NOT use the forensic workstation. You'll work on your **host machine** consolidating evidence.

### 1. Verify Final_Report Templates Are Ready

The lab folder should already contain template files. Verify they exist:

```bash
# On your host machine
ls -lh cases/Final_Report/
```

You should see:

- **chain_of_custody.csv** - Evidence handling record (from all labs)
- **analysis_log.csv** - Master command log (optional for consolidation)
- **lab_report.md** - Available if alternative format needed
- **final_report.md** - Report template for comprehensive incident synthesis (PRIMARY)
- **WALKTHROUGH.md** - This document

**What each file does:**

| File | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **chain_of_custody.csv** | Master evidence record from all 5 labs | Before starting - consolidate all evidence hashes |
| **analysis_log.csv** | Optional master log if tracking all commands | During lab - optional for tracking consolidated analysis |
| **final_report.md** | Template for comprehensive incident investigation | Main deliverable - synthesize all evidence into narrative |
| **lab_report.md** | Alternative format if needed | Optional - individual lab-style reporting |

If any files are missing, copy them from templates/:

```bash
# Copy missing templates (if needed)
cp templates/chain_of_custody.csv cases/Final_Report/chain_of_custody.csv
cp templates/analysis_log.csv cases/Final_Report/analysis_log.csv
cp templates/lab_report_template.md cases/Final_Report/lab_report.md
cp templates/final_report_template.md cases/Final_Report/final_report.md
```

**Tips for using these files:**

- **chain_of_custody.csv**: Consolidate evidence records from all 5 lab folders. This becomes your master evidence list.
- **final_report.md**: Use this as your primary template. It's designed for synthesizing evidence from multiple sources into a unified incident narrative.
- **lab_report.md**: Available if you prefer the individual lab format instead of the comprehensive final report format.

### 2. Review All Previous Labs

Open these folders and review all findings and evidence:
```bash
cases/USB_Imaging/        # Files, deleted items, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Memory_Forensics/   # Processes, network connections, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Email_Logs/         # Communications, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
cases/Network_Analysis/   # Traffic, exfiltration, lab_report.md, chain_of_custody.csv, analysis_log.csv
```

**Key documents to review:**

- Each lab's `lab_report.md` for analysis and findings
- Each lab's `chain_of_custody.csv` for evidence details and hashes
- Each lab's `analysis_log.csv` for methodology transparency

---

## üìä Part 1: Consolidate Chain of Custody

Combine hashes from all 5 labs into a master file.

**Open these files:**

- cases/USB_Imaging/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Memory_Forensics/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Email_Logs/chain_of_custody.csv
- cases/Network_Analysis/chain_of_custody.csv

**In cases/Final_Report/master_chain_of_custody.csv:**
Add one row for EACH evidence item with:

- Evidence_ID: USB-001, MEMORY-001, EMAIL-001, NETWORK-001
- Date_Received: (when seized)
- MD5_Hash: (from each lab)
- SHA256_Hash: (from each lab)
- Analyst_Name: (your name)
- Evidence_Description: Brief description

**Example row:**
```
USB-001,2024-10-20,14:00:00,Field Agent,fc8096...,6ebe35...,Michael,CASE-2024-001,"16GB SanDisk USB (usb.img)",./cases/secure_evidence/
```

---

## üìù Part 2: Consolidate Analysis Log

Combine all commands run across all 5 labs.

**Open these files:**

- cases/USB_Imaging/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Memory_Forensics/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Email_Logs/analysis_log.csv
- cases/Network_Analysis/analysis_log.csv

**In cases/Final_Report/master_analysis_log.csv:**
Copy all rows from each of the 4 labs' analysis_log.csv files in chronological order.

**Sort by timestamp_utc** to create a complete timeline of analysis activities.

---

## üîç Part 3: Build Master Timeline

Create a comprehensive timeline showing WHEN attacks happened.

**File:** cases/Final_Report/MASTER_TIMELINE.txt

```
CLOUDCORE INCIDENT TIMELINE
Case: CLOUDCORE-2024-INS-001

=== PHASE 1: MALWARE INSTALLATION ===
[2009-12-05 02:11:23 UTC] - Keylogger installed and started

- Evidence: ToolKeylogger.exe process (PID 280) from Memory_Forensics
- Parent process: explorer.exe (normal user process)
- Network libraries loaded: WININET.dll, urlmon.dll, iertutil.dll
- Indicates: [suspect's system compromised with keylogger for credential theft]

=== PHASE 2: DATA STAGING ===
[2009-12-05 to 2009-12-06] - Files copied to USB

- Evidence: project_secrets.txt (inode 375) from USB_Imaging
- Content: Database credentials (db_pass=TempPass_2009!) and client data
- Backup copies: project_secrets_backup.txt (inode 1715)
- Email draft: email_draft.txt (inode 663) about security concerns
- Indicates: [suspect staging sensitive data for exfiltration]

=== PHASE 3: EMAIL EXFILTRATION ===
[2009-12-07 09:45:00 UTC] - Data sent via email

- Evidence: Email from Email_Logs analysis
- Sender: alex@cloudcore.com
- Recipient: exfil@personal.com (external personal account)
- Subject: "Project Update" (suspicious subject line)
- Attachment: project_secrets.zip (matches USB content)
- Indicates: [intentional data exfiltration to external address]

=== PHASE 4: NETWORK ACTIVITY ===
[2009-12-06 10:30-10:45 UTC] - Network traffic analysis

- Evidence: Network_Analysis PCAP shows keylogger C2 communication
- Keylogger exfiltration: Captured keystrokes sent to attacker server
- Timeline: Overlaps with USB staging and email preparation
- Indicates: [automated credential theft supporting insider attack]

=== PHASE 5: COVER-UP ===
[2009-12-07 after email] - Files deleted from USB

- Evidence: Multiple deleted files with "*" prefix in USB_Imaging
- Deleted: project_secrets.txt, email_draft.txt, flag_backup.txt
- Pattern: Intentional deletion of incriminating evidence
- Indicates: [suspect attempting to hide tracks after exfiltration]

=== CONCLUSION ===
Timeline shows coordinated insider attack assisted by external malware:

1. Keylogger installed (external compromise)
2. Credentials captured via keylogger
3. Sensitive data staged on USB using stolen credentials
4. Data exfiltrated via personal email account
5. Evidence deleted to cover tracks
Total duration: ~2 days (2009-12-05 to 2009-12-07)
```

   - Why was that more important than others?

2. **What did each lab contribute?**
   - Could we have solved it with just Lab 1? Lab 2?
   - Why was having all 5 labs necessary?

3. **What challenges did you face?**
   - Command syntax errors?
   - Evidence interpretation?
   - Thinking like an attacker?

4. **What would you do differently?**
   - Better search keywords?
   - Different tools?
   - Different analysis order?

5. **How confident in your conclusion?**
   - Strong (multiple corroborating sources)

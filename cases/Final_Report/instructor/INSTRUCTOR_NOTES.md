# Lab 6 Instructor Notes - Final Case Report

## Overview
Lab 6 is the synthesis phase where students consolidate findings from Labs 1-5 into a unified investigation narrative. This is where students demonstrate understanding of how individual artifacts connect to prove the insider threat hypothesis.

## Key Teaching Points
- Professional report writing for forensic findings
- Timeline correlation across multiple evidence sources
- Distinguishing facts from conclusions
- Chain of custody narrative integration
- Recommendations and impact assessment

## Expected Report Structure
Students should address:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Incident overview
   - Key findings summary
   - Recommended actions

2. **Investigation Methodology** (1-2 pages)
   - Evidence collected and analyzed
   - Tools used (CLI vs GUI)
   - Limitations and constraints

3. **Detailed Findings** (3-5 pages)
   - Disk forensics (deleted files, timestamps)
   - Memory forensics (TrueCrypt, network connections)
   - Email and logs (correlation)
   - Network traffic (exfiltration)
   - Timeline integration

4. **Chain of Custody Summary**
   - Reference to CoC logs from all labs
   - Hash verification confirmations
   - Analyst integrity statement

5. **Conclusions** (1 page)
   - Evidence supports insider threat hypothesis
   - Estimated data exfiltrated
   - Timeline of exfiltration
   - Recommended escalation (law enforcement)

## Grading Focus
Award high marks for:
- Clear correlation between different evidence types
- Proper documentation of CoC
- Professional presentation
- Avoiding unsupported conclusions
- Addressing counter-evidence objectively

## Common Issues
1. Students making accusations instead of reporting facts
2. Forgetting to reference Lab 2 memory findings
3. Missing email-USB timeline correlation (Lab 4)
4. Incomplete CoC integration from earlier labs
5. Weak recommendations/impact analysis

## Assessment Rubric Elements
- Report organization and clarity (20%)
- Accurate evidence integration (40%)
- Proper CoC documentation (20%)
- Professional presentation (10%)
- Critical analysis/recommendations (10%)

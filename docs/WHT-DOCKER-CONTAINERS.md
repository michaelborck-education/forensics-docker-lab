## Justification for Using Docker Containers in the Cyber Forensics Curriculum

### 1. Introduction: The Challenge of a Modern Classroom

The primary goal of our Cyber Forensics course is to provide practical, hands-on experience to all students. However, our student cohort is increasingly diverse in its technological makeup. We must support students using:

* **Multiple Operating Systems:** macOS, Windows, and ChromeOS.
* **Divergent CPU Architectures:** The critical split between traditional Intel/AMD (x86) processors and Apple Silicon (ARM) processors.
* **Varying Hardware Capabilities:** A wide range of device power, from high-end laptops to resource-constrained Chromebooks.

Traditional teaching methods relying on full virtualization platforms like VirtualBox or VMware are no longer viable. They create a fractured and inequitable learning environment due to high resource requirements and, most critically, their inability to run x86 virtual machines on ARM-based hardware. This document outlines the rationale for adopting Docker containers as our core instructional platform, a solution that directly addresses these challenges while providing robust pedagogical benefits.

### 2. Solving the Technical Divide with Docker

As established in our "Comparison of Virtualization & Containerization Tools," Docker provides a unified solution to the technical hurdles that plague traditional virtualization.

* **Accessibility for All:** Docker's lightweight nature ensures it runs effectively on virtually any modern laptop, including lower-powered Chromebooks (via the Linux environment). This eliminates the barrier of high RAM and disk space requirements, democratizing access to the course material.
* **The Multi-Architecture Solution:** This is Docker's most compelling technical advantage. Using `docker buildx`, we can create a single, multi-architecture image. When a student runs a `docker pull` command, the platform automatically delivers the version compatible with their CPU (`x86` or `ARM`). This single feature elegantly solves the most significant technical challenge we face, allowing us to maintain a single, unified set of instructions for all students, regardless of their hardware.
* **Consistency and Reproducibility:** Docker containers ensure that every student works within an identical, controlled environment. This eliminates frustrating setup issues and the "it works on my machine" problem, allowing students and instructors to focus on forensic concepts rather than technical troubleshooting.

### 3. Aligning with the Pedagogical Goals of Cyber Forensics

Our choice is not merely one of convenience; it is pedagogically sound. As detailed in "Understanding the Investigation Environment," Docker allows us to teach essential modern forensic skills effectively, even while acknowledging its limitations for traditional hardware acquisition.

#### Acknowledging the Limitations
We recognize that containers, as an abstraction layer, are unsuited for teaching low-level forensic acquisition. Students will not use Docker to perform bit-for-bit disk imaging or to interact with hardware write-blockers. These foundational concepts will be taught theoretically and through targeted demonstrations.

#### Focusing on Higher-Level and Modern Skills
Docker provides an unparalleled environment for teaching the procedural and analytical skills that form the core of a modern investigator's toolkit:

1.  **The Portable Analysis Lab:** This is the cornerstone of our practical curriculum. We can provide students with a Docker container pre-loaded with a full suite of complex forensic tools (The Sleuth Kit, Volatility, etc.).  They can then use this consistent, clean-room environment to analyse pre-acquired disk and memory images (`evidence.dd`, `memory.vmem`). This bypasses hours of frustrating tool installation and allows students to immediately engage in hands-on analysis of realistic evidence.

2.  **Live Response Simulation:** We can provide running containers that simulate compromised systems (e.g., a web server). Students can practice essential live-response techniques by examining running processes, analysing log files, and identifying active network connections in a safe, ephemeral environment.

3.  **Reinforcing the Chain of Custody:** Containers are perfect for procedural drills. Students can practice identifying, collecting, hashing, and documenting evidence from within a simulated environment, reinforcing the critical importance of maintaining the chain of custody.

### 4. Conclusion: A Practical and Forward-Looking Choice

The adoption of Docker containers is a strategic decision that best serves the needs of our diverse student body and the pedagogical goals of a modern Cyber Forensics course.

It is the only platform that solves the critical technical challenges of hardware and CPU diversity, ensuring an equitable and accessible learning experience for all. More importantly, it allows us to focus on teaching high-demand skills in analysis and procedure within a clean, reproducible, and powerful learning environment. By embracing this modern approach, we are not only overcoming logistical hurdles but are also preparing our students with tools and workflows that are increasingly relevant in the technology industry.

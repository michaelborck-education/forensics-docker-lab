Quick Summary

Date: January 16, 2024 Case Number: CLOUDCORE-2024-INS-001

Cloudcore Corporation’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system detected anomalous data transfer patterns over the past month. Security footage revealed an employee accessing multiple workstations outside of normal business hours. During a consensual search of the employee’s workspace, a concealed USB device was discovered.

Your Role: As the junior forensic analyst, you must conduct an initial triage examination of this USB device to determine: - What data is present on the device - What files have been deleted - Whether client data was exfiltrated - Timeline of device usage

Critical Intelligence: The suspect had authorized access to: - Client database exports (CSV format) - Financial reports (PDF/DOCX) - Proprietary source code - Internal email archives
Required Tools

All tools are pre-installed in the Docker forensic environment - see README.md for setup instructions.
Primary Tools (Required)

Objective: Establish proper evidence handling procedures and verify integrity.

    Verify Evidence Integrity
        Calculate MD5 hash of /evidence/cloudcore_suspect_usb.E01
        Calculate SHA256 hash of /evidence/cloudcore_suspect_usb.E01
        Verify E01 internal integrity using ewfverify
        Document current date, time, and your student ID as analyst ID
    Create Chain of Custody Documentation
        Create a properly formatted chain_of_custody.csv file with these fields:
            Evidence_ID (create unique identifier, e.g., EVIDENCE-2024-001)
            Date_Received (use January 16, 2024)
            Time_Received (use 08:30 AM)

            Student_ID (your student ID)
            Case_Number (CLOUDCORE-2024-INS-001)
            Evidence_Description (brief description of USB device)
            Storage_Location (use “/evidence - read-only archive”)
            Verification_Status (result of ewfverify)

💡 Hint: See COMMANDS.md for hash calculation and verification commands.
Task 2: Forensic Analysis (10 points)

Objective: Conduct comprehensive file system analysis to identify evidence of data exfiltration.
2.1 Evidence Mounting and File System Information (Required)

    Mount the E01 Evidence File

    First, enter the forensic workstation: docker compose run --rm dfir

    Then run these commands inside the workstation:

    mkdir -p /tmp/ewf
    ewfmount /evidence/cloudcore_suspect_usb.E01 /tmp/ewf

Extract File System Information

# Get file system details
fsstat /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/filesystem_info.txt

# Display partition information (if multi-partition)
mmls /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/partition_info.txt

2.2 File Listing and Timeline Creation (Required)

    Generate Complete File Listing

    # List ALL files including deleted (look for * marker)
    fls -r -d /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/file_list.txt

    # Create machine-readable timeline
    fls -r -d -m / /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/filesystem_timeline.csv

    Analyze the File List
        Identify total number of files (active and deleted)
        Note suspicious filenames (client, confidential, database, etc.)
        Identify deleted files (marked with * in output)
        Look for archive files (.zip, .7z, .tar, .rar)
        Find database exports (.csv, .sql, .xlsx)

2.3 File Recovery (Required)

    Bulk Recovery

    # Create recovery directory
    mkdir -p /cases/recovered

    # Recover all files (including deleted)
    tsk_recover /tmp/ewf/ewf1 /cases/recovered

Targeted Recovery of Key Files

    Identify files of interest from your file listing
    Use icat to extract specific files by inode:

# Example: icat /tmp/ewf/ewf1 [inode-number] > /cases/specific_file.ext

    Organize Recovered Files
        Separate deleted files from active files
        Categorize by file type (documents, databases, archives, etc.)
        Create subdirectories in /cases/recovered/ for organization

2.4 Content Analysis (Required)

    Keyword Search Search for the following keywords (case-insensitive):
        “confidential”
        “password” or “credential”
        “cloudcore”
        “client” or “customer”
        “database” or “export”

    # Example keyword search
    strings /tmp/ewf/ewf1 | grep -iE "client|confidential|password" > /cases/keyword_hits.txt

    Document Keyword Hits
        Record which files contain sensitive keywords
        Note context of keyword usage
        Screenshot or save examples of concerning content

2.5 Optional: GUI Verification with Autopsy

Note: This is completely optional. CLI analysis is sufficient for full marks.

If you want to verify findings with a GUI: 1. Uncomment autopsy service in docker-compose.yml 2. Run docker compose up -d 3. Access Autopsy at http://localhost:8080/vnc.html 4. Import E01 file and compare findings

This is provided for learning purposes only and provides no grade advantage.
2.6 Documentation Requirements (Critical)

You must document: - Every command you executed (copy-paste from terminal) - Purpose of each command - Key findings from each step - Screenshots of significant terminal output - Any unexpected results or errors encountered

💡 Hint: Keep a log file as you work:

# Save command history
history > /cases/command_log.txt

Task 3: Reporting (5 points)

Objective: Produce a professional forensic triage report suitable for management review and potential legal proceedings.

    Specific prompts or queries you found most effective
    Limitations or challenges encountered with AI assistance
    Ethical considerations when using AI in forensic investigations
    How you verified AI-generated suggestions before using them

Note: Using AI tools is permitted and encouraged for learning, but you must: - Document your AI usage transparently - Verify all AI-generated commands before execution - Ensure you understand what each command does - Not copy-paste AI responses directly into your report without understanding
Special Considerations for This Case
Look Specifically For:

    Client Data Indicators:
        Files containing “client_list”, “customer_database”
        CSV exports with suspicious names
        Large numbers of records in structured formats
    Exfiltration Preparation:
        Archive files (evidence of data packaging)
        Script files (.bat, .ps1, .sh, .py)
        Encryption tools or encrypted files
    Timeline Analysis:
        Clustering of file deletions
        After-hours timestamps
        Rapid file creation/deletion patterns

Ethical Note

Remember: Your analysis may be used in legal proceedings that could affect someone’s career and liberty. Report facts objectively, avoid speculation, and document both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence equally.

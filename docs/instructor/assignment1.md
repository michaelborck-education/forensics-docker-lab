**Quick Summary**

Date: December 5-6, 2009
Case Number: CLOUDCORE-2009-INS-001

Cloudcore Inc.'s security team detected suspicious USB activity on employee workstations. During a workspace audit on December 6, 2009, a concealed USB storage device was discovered in the desk drawer of a recently terminated employee.

**Your Role:** As a junior forensic analyst, conduct an initial triage examination of the USB device to:

1. Identify what data is currently on the device
2. Recover deleted files and analyze their content
3. Determine whether client data was exfiltrated
4. Build a timeline of device usage and file operations

**Critical Intelligence:** The suspect had authorized access to:
- Client database exports (CSV format)
- Financial reports (PDF/DOCX)
- Proprietary source code
- Internal email archives

## Tasks
### Task 1: Evidence Handling and Chain of Custody (2.5 points)

**Objective:** Establish proper evidence handling procedures and verify integrity.

#### 1.1 Verify Evidence Integrity

- Calculate MD5 hash of `/evidence/usb.E01`
- Calculate SHA256 hash of `/evidence/usb.E01`
- Verify E01 internal integrity using `ewfverify`
- Document current date, time, and your student ID as analyst ID

#### 1.2 Create Chain of Custody Documentation

Create a properly formatted **chain_of_custody.csv** with these fields:

- Evidence_ID (create unique identifier, e.g., USB-2009-001)
- Date_Received (use December 6, 2009)
- Time_Received (use 14:00)
- Received_From ("Cloudcore Security Team")
- MD5_Hash (your calculated value)
- SHA256_Hash (your calculated value)
- Analyst_Name (your name)
- Student_ID (your student ID)
- Case_Number (CLOUDCORE-2009-INS-001)
- Evidence_Description (brief description of USB device)
- Storage_Location ("/evidence - read-only archive")
- Verification_Status (result of ewfverify)
### Task 2: Forensic Analysis (10 points)

**Objective:** Conduct comprehensive file system analysis to identify evidence of data exfiltration.

#### 2.1 Evidence Mounting and File System Information (Required)

**Mount the E01 Evidence File:**

Enter the forensic workstation:
```bash
docker compose run --rm dfir
```

Then run these commands inside the workstation:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/ewf
ewfmount /evidence/usb.E01 /tmp/ewf
```

**Extract File System Information:**

```bash
# Get file system details
fsstat /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/filesystem_info.txt

# Display partition information (if multi-partition)
mmls /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/partition_info.txt
```

#### 2.2 File Listing and Timeline Creation (Required)

**Generate Complete File Listing:**

```bash
# List ALL files including deleted (look for * marker)
fls -r -d /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/file_list.txt

# Create machine-readable timeline
fls -r -d -m / /tmp/ewf/ewf1 > /cases/filesystem_timeline.csv
```

**Analyze the File List:**
- Identify total number of files (active and deleted)
- Note suspicious filenames (client, confidential, database, etc.)
- Identify deleted files (marked with `*` in output)
- Look for archive files (.zip, .7z, .tar, .rar)
- Find database exports (.csv, .sql, .xlsx)

#### 2.3 File Recovery (Required)

**Bulk Recovery:**

```bash
# Create recovery directory
mkdir -p /cases/recovered

# Recover all files (including deleted)
tsk_recover /tmp/ewf/ewf1 /cases/recovered
```

**Targeted Recovery of Key Files:**

- Identify files of interest from your file listing
- Use `icat` to extract specific files by inode:

```bash
# Example: icat /tmp/ewf/ewf1 [inode-number] > /cases/specific_file.ext
```

**Organize Recovered Files:**
- Separate deleted files from active files
- Categorize by file type (documents, databases, archives, etc.)
- Create subdirectories in `/cases/recovered/` for organization

#### 2.4 Content Analysis (Required)

**Keyword Search:**

Search for the following keywords (case-insensitive):
- "confidential"
- "password" or "credential"
- "cloudcore"
- "client" or "customer"
- "database" or "export"

```bash
# Example keyword search
strings /tmp/ewf/ewf1 | grep -iE "client|confidential|password" > /cases/keyword_hits.txt
```

**Document Keyword Hits:**
- Record which files contain sensitive keywords
- Note context of keyword usage
- Screenshot or save examples of concerning content

#### 2.5 Optional: GUI Verification with Autopsy

Note: This is completely optional. CLI analysis is sufficient for full marks.

If you want to verify findings with a GUI:
1. Uncomment autopsy service in docker-compose.yml
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Access Autopsy at http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
4. Import E01 file and compare findings

#### 2.6 Documentation Requirements (Critical)

You must document:
- Every command you executed (copy-paste from terminal)
- Purpose of each command
- Key findings from each step
- Screenshots of significant terminal output
- Any unexpected results or errors encountered

**Hint:** Keep a log file as you work:
```bash
# Save command history
history > /cases/command_log.txt
```

### Task 3: Reporting (5 points)

❌ Not saving outputs to `/cases/` directory
❌ Running forensic commands on your laptop instead of inside the forensic workstation

### Analysis Mistakes

❌ Not including deleted files in analysis (forgetting `-d` flag)
❌ Ignoring exculpatory evidence (only reporting incriminating findings)
❌ Over-reliance on single tool without verification
❌ Not organizing recovered files by category
❌ Failing to document unexpected results or errors

### Reporting Mistakes

❌ Making accusations instead of presenting objective facts
❌ Not documenting every command executed
❌ Missing screenshots of significant findings
❌ Reporting AI-generated content without verification
❌ Using non-professional language or speculation
❌ Exceeding or falling short of word count significantly

- **Due Date:** Friday 7th November 2025
- **Submission Type:** Individual
- **Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours (report synthesis and professional writing)

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this assessment, students will be able to:

1. Synthesize findings from multiple forensic domains into a cohesive incident narrative
2. Correlate evidence across different evidence sources (disk, memory, email, network)
3. Produce a professional forensic investigation report suitable for legal proceedings
4. Establish timelines using cross-source evidence correlation
5. Communicate complex forensic findings to non-technical stakeholders

## Investigation Background

📖 **This assessment synthesizes findings from Assignments 1 and 2.**

**Quick Summary**

Date: December 5-6, 2009
Case Number: CLOUDCORE-2009-INS-FINAL

Following comprehensive analysis across storage media (USB), volatile memory (RAM), email archives, and network traffic, the complete forensic investigation is now consolidated. Your task is to synthesize all evidence into a unified, professional incident investigation report demonstrating the full scope of the data breach.

**Your Role:** As a lead forensic analyst, you must produce a comprehensive investigation report that:

- Consolidates evidence from all previous labs into a master chain of custody
- Creates a unified timeline showing when attacks occurred and how they progressed
- Establishes evidence correlations across multiple sources
- Documents methodology transparently for reproducibility
- Presents conclusions with confidence levels based on corroborating evidence
- Provides actionable recommendations for remediation and prevention

---

## Required Prior Work

This assignment **requires completion** of:

- ✅ Assignment 1: USB Evidence Triage (storage media forensics)
- ✅ Assignment 2: Memory & Email Forensics Investigation (volatile memory and communications analysis)

**OR equivalent independent lab work covering:**

- USB/disk forensics analysis
- Memory forensics analysis

## Special Considerations

### Synthesis Challenges

**Timestamp Discrepancies:**
- Different evidence sources may have different timestamp granularity
- Time zone conversions (ensure all times documented as UTC)
- System clocks may be incorrect or manipulated
- Document assumptions about timestamp reliability

**Evidence Conflicts:**
- What if disk evidence contradicts memory evidence?
- What if email timestamps don't align with file creation times?
- Document discrepancies and explain most likely interpretation
- Don't ignore contradictory evidence; explain it

**Missing Evidence:**
- Some events may leave no forensic trace
- Some time periods may have gaps in evidence
- Document what remains unknown
- Distinguish between proven facts and reasonable inferences

### Ethical Standards

Remember:

- Your report may determine someone's career, liberty, and livelihood
- Report **all** findings objectively—both inculpatory and exculpatory
- Make no accusations; present facts and let evidence speak for itself
- Avoid speculation without supporting evidence
- Clearly distinguish between "I found evidence that..." vs. "This suggests that..."

### Professional Standards

Follow these digital forensics best practices:

- **Reproducibility:** All commands and procedures documented so others can verify
- **Chain of Custody:** Maintained throughout investigation for legal admissibility
- **Expert Testimony:** Report should be suitable as evidence in legal proceedings
- **Peer Review:** Methodology should withstand scrutiny from other forensic experts
- **Standards Compliance:** Reference ISO 27037, ACPO, or NIST guidelines where applicable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Data Organization Mistakes

❌ Not consolidating all evidence hashes into single master file
❌ Missing evidence items from specific labs
❌ Inconsistent timestamp formats (mix of UTC and local time)
❌ Hash values from analysis (not original evidence)

### Timeline Mistakes

❌ Creating timeline with only one evidence source (defeats purpose)
❌ Inventing timestamps not supported by actual evidence
❌ Assuming causation without evidence (A happened, then B happened ≠ A caused B)
❌ Not explaining how timestamps were derived
❌ Timeline events that contradict each other

### Report Mistakes

❌ Repeating Assignment 1 & 2 findings without synthesis
❌ Failing to cite specific evidence (vague references like "malware found")
❌ Making accusations instead of presenting facts
❌ Ignoring exculpatory evidence or contradictions
❌ Exceeding word count with unnecessary detail
❌ Missing required sections (limitations, methodology, etc.)
❌ Not explaining significance of findings
❌ Poor professional formatting

### Correlation Mistakes

❌ Showing evidence from only one source per finding
❌ Not explaining how evidence from different sources corroborate
❌ Claiming correlation without supporting evidence
❌ Ignoring evidence that contradicts main narrative
❌ Failing to document discrepancies between sources

---

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Workstation Experience
```bash
# Students now do this:
docker compose run --rm dfir

# They see a banner and get a bash prompt:
analyst@forensics-lab:/cases$

# Then run commands directly:
fls -r /evidence/disk.img
tsk_recover /evidence/disk.img recovered/
grep -i "password" Lab_1/*.txt
```

### 2. Welcome Banner
Displays on every login with:
- Available tools (Sleuth Kit, YARA, exiftool, etc.)
- Workspace structure (/evidence read-only, /cases writable)
- Forensic best practices reminders
- Quick command examples
- Tips for efficient work

### 3. Forensic-Themed Prompt
```bash
analyst@forensics-lab:/cases$  # Green user, blue path
```

### 4. Persistent Command History
- History saved to `cases/.bash_history`
- Available across sessions
- Students can review what they did

### 5. Maintains Flexibility
Still supports one-off commands:
```bash
docker compose run --rm dfir fls -r /evidence/disk.img
```

---

## Architecture Decision

**Chose:** Single Debian-based container with interactive support for ALL labs

**Rejected:** Per-lab Alpine containers (Lab 2 needs Volatility3, Alpine incompatible)

**Rationale:**
- Volatility 3 requires full Python environment (not available in Alpine easily)
- One container = consistent environment across all 6 labs
- Debian package support for all tools needed
- Add interactive banner without sacrificing functionality

---

## Technical Details

### Dockerfile Changes
- Base: `debian:stable-slim`
- Installed: sleuthkit, testdisk, foremost, ewf-tools, exiftool, hashdeep, yara, python3
- Added: vim, nano, curl, wget, grep, findutils (for student convenience)
- Volatility3: Installed via pip (with `--break-system-packages` for Debian)
- Entrypoint: Custom script to display banner and set prompt
- CMD: `/bin/bash` for interactive mode

### Docker Compose Changes
- Added `stdin_open: true` - Keeps STDIN open for input
- Added `tty: true` - Allocates pseudo-TTY for terminal features
- Updated comments with usage examples

### Banner Content
- Tools list (accurate, tested)
- Specialized containers note (Volatility, Plaso run separately)
- Workspace structure
- Forensic best practices (never modify evidence, document everything, CoC)
- Quick command examples
- Tips for efficiency

---

## Lab README Updates

### Lab 1 (Disk Forensics)
- Added Step 0: Build and enter workstation
- Reorganized steps to show interactive workflow
- Added "Alternative: One-Off Commands" section
- Clarified when to exit workstation vs when to stay in

### Lab 2 (Memory Forensics)
- **Fixed critical bug:** Changed all `memdump.raw` → `memory.raw` (matches actual file)
- Added Step 0: Build and enter workstation
- Clarified that Volatility runs in separate container (on host)
- Added analysis step to review outputs inside workstation
- Added reference to WALKTHROUGH.md

---

## Documentation Created

### COMMANDS.md
Comprehensive quick reference covering:
- Getting started (entering workstation)
- Chain of custody
- Lab 1: Disk forensics (TSK, Foremost, carving)
- Lab 2: Memory forensics (Volatility commands)
- Timeline analysis (Plaso)
- Search & pattern matching (grep, YARA)
- Hashing & verification
- Documentation & reporting
- Network analysis prep (Lab 5)
- Tips & troubleshooting

### Lab 2 WALKTHROUGH.md
Detailed step-by-step with:
- Case context (2009 Cloudcore investigation)
- Prerequisites checklist
- Lab setup instructions
- 7 analysis steps with expected outputs
- "What to look for" guidance for each step
- Analysis questions to answer

---

## Testing Results

✅ **Docker build:** Successful (499MB image)
✅ **Banner display:** Working perfectly
✅ **Sleuth Kit:** Tested (`fls -V` → v4.12.1)
✅ **YARA:** Tested (`yara --version` → 4.5.2)
✅ **Volatility 3:** Installed (separate vol3 container tested separately)
✅ **Interactive mode:** Functional with banner and prompt
✅ **One-off commands:** Still work as expected

### Known Limitations
- **Volatility in dfir container:** Won't work (needs writable cache). Solution: Use separate `vol3` container as documented.
- **bulk_extractor:** Not in Debian stable repos (removed from banner)

---

## Student Workflow Now

### Before (Old Way):
```bash
docker compose run --rm dfir fls -r /evidence/disk.img > cases/Lab_1/fls.txt
docker compose run --rm dfir tsk_recover -a /evidence/disk.img /cases/Lab_1/tsk_recover_out
docker compose run --rm dfir grep -i "password" /cases/Lab_1/*.txt
```
Every command needs full `docker compose run --rm dfir` prefix.

### After (New Way):
```bash
# Enter workstation once
docker compose run --rm dfir

# Inside workstation (see banner)
fls -r /evidence/disk.img > Lab_1/fls.txt
tsk_recover -a /evidence/disk.img Lab_1/tsk_recover_out
grep -i "password" Lab_1/*.txt

# Exit when done
exit
```
Much less typing, more immersive, realistic forensic experience.

## Next Steps for Instructor

### Immediate:
1. Test the interactive workstation yourself:
   ```bash
   docker compose build dfir
   docker compose run --rm dfir
   # Try some commands from COMMANDS.md
   ```

2. Review the Lab 2 WALKTHROUGH.md and decide if level of detail is appropriate

3. Update other lab READMEs (Lab 3-6) with interactive workflow if desired

### Before First Class:
1. Have students run setup:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   cd forensics-docker-lab
   docker compose build dfir
   docker compose run --rm dfir
   ```

2. Show them the banner and explain workspace structure

3. Demonstrate a few commands (fls, grep, tsk_recover)

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Add more lab walkthroughs (Lab 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
2. Create video walkthrough of first 10 minutes
3. Add sample completed reports (instructor-only folder)
4. Create quiz questions based on expected findings

---

## Files Students Will Use

Primary workflow documents:
- `SETUP.md` - Initial setup and entering workstation
- `COMMANDS.md` - Quick reference for all commands
- `cases/Lab_X/README.md` - Per-lab instructions
- `cases/Lab_2/WALKTHROUGH.md` - Detailed Lab 2 guidance

Supporting docs:
- `STORYLINE.md` - Case background
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues
- Lab templates (`triage_report.md`, `memory_report.md`)

---

## Maintenance Notes

### If tools need updating:
1. Update `images/dfir-cli/Dockerfile` (add/remove apt packages)
2. Update `images/dfir-cli/banner.txt` (reflect tool changes)
3. Rebuild: `docker compose build dfir`

### If banner needs changes:
1. Edit `images/dfir-cli/banner.txt`
2. Rebuild: `docker compose build dfir`

### If prompt needs customization:
1. Edit `images/dfir-cli/entrypoint.sh` (PS1 variable)
2. Rebuild: `docker compose build dfir`

---

## Success Metrics

After students complete labs, check:
- [ ] Students successfully enter workstation (see banner)
- [ ] Students run commands without `docker compose run` prefix
- [ ] Command history exists in `cases/.bash_history`
- [ ] Students report less confusion about file paths
- [ ] Student feedback: More immersive/realistic experience
- [ ] Completion times within expected ranges (see INSTRUCTOR_NOTES.md)

---

## Contact for Issues

If students encounter problems:
1. Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` first
2. Verify Docker is running: `docker compose ps`
3. Rebuild if needed: `docker compose build dfir`
4. Check file permissions: `ls -la evidence/`
5. Verify PUID/PGID in `.env` matches user

Common issues:
- "Banner doesn't show" → Rebuild image
- "Command not found" → Make sure they're inside workstation
- "Permission denied" → Check PUID/PGID, evidence must be readable
- "Can't write files" → Must write to /cases (which maps to cases/)

---

## Summary

✅ **Implementation complete**
✅ **All files created/updated**
✅ **Tested and working**
✅ **Documentation comprehensive**
✅ **Ready for student use**

The forensic lab now provides an immersive, interactive workstation experience while maintaining full compatibility with all 6 labs and supporting both interactive and one-off command workflows.

# Scripts Directory - Organization & Usage

## üìç Overview

This directory contains utility scripts for the Forensics Docker Lab. They're organized into three categories:

```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forensics-workstation      ‚Üê START HERE (bash/Linux/Mac)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forensics-workstation.ps1  ‚Üê START HERE (PowerShell/Windows)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coc-log                     ‚Üê Use inside forensic workstation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ verify_setup.sh             ‚Üê Run once to verify setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ instructor/                 ‚Üê Instructor-only tools
```

## üë®‚Äçüéì For Students

### Primary Entry Point

**On macOS/Linux/Windows WSL:**
```bash
./scripts/forensics-workstation
```

**On Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\scripts\forensics-workstation.ps1
```

Both scripts:
- Prompt for your analyst name
- Check Docker is running
- Verify evidence files exist
- Display the forensic lab banner
- Connect you to the DFIR workstation

### Inside the Workstation

Once connected, use the chain of custody logging tool:

```bash
analyst@forensics-lab:/cases$ coc-log "your command" "description"
```

This automatically:
- Records timestamp and analyst name
- Executes your command
- Hashes the output
- Saves output files
- Logs to analysis_log.csv

### Initial Lab Verification

Before starting, verify your setup is correct:

```bash
./scripts/verify_setup.sh
```

This checks:
- Docker is installed and running
- Directory structure is correct
- Evidence files are accessible
- Forensic tools are available
- New features (forensics-workstation, coc-log) are ready

## üë®‚Äçüè´ For Instructors

### Creating Evidence Files

**Move to instructor branch first:**
```bash
git checkout instructor
```

**Available tools in `scripts/instructor/`:**

1. **Image Creation (varies by platform)**
   - `legacy/make_practice_image_container.sh` - Cross-platform (recommended)
   - `legacy/make_practice_image_simple.sh` - Alternative approach
   - `legacy/make_practice_image.sh` - Original version (needs sudo)

2. **E01 Conversion** (multiple approaches in `legacy/`)
   - `legacy/convert_to_e01_container.sh` - Docker-based (cross-platform)
   - `legacy/convert_to_e01_fixed.sh` - Improved version
   - `legacy/convert_to_e01_simple.sh` - Simple version

3. **Utilities**
   - `instructor/hashlog.py` - Generate hash logs for chain of custody
   - `legacy/shift_time.sh` - Adjust timestamps on evidence

### Creating/Updating Evidence Images

```bash
# Full workflow (assuming you're on instructor branch)
cd /path/to/forensics-docker-lab

# Create raw disk image with forensic evidence
./scripts/legacy/make_practice_image_container.sh

# Convert to E01 format
./scripts/legacy/convert_to_e01_container.sh

# Generate hash logs
python3 scripts/instructor/hashlog.py evidence/ evidence/hashes.csv SHA256
```

### Distributing to Students

1. Evidence files should be distributed separately (OneDrive/cloud)
2. Students download and place in `evidence/` folder
3. They should NOT clone instructor branch
4. Main branch is automatically used by default

---

## üìö Legacy Scripts - Reference Only

These are in `scripts/legacy/` for reference and are NOT recommended for new use:

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `make_practice_image.sh` | Create practice image (original) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires sudo |
| `make_practice_image_simple.sh` | Create practice image (alternative) | ‚úì Works but slower |
| `make_practice_image_container.sh` | Create practice image (Docker) | ‚úÖ **Recommended** |
| `convert_to_e01*.sh` | Various E01 conversion methods | ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent |
| `entrypoint.sh` | Container startup (moved here) | Legacy |
| `autopsy-entrypoint.sh` | Autopsy GUI entry | Legacy |
| `diagnose-windows.sh` | Windows diagnostics | Legacy |
| `shift_time.sh` | Timestamp adjustment | Legacy |
| `fix-line-endings.sh` | Line ending conversion | Legacy |

## üîß Script Details

### forensics-workstation (bash)

**Usage:**

### forensics-workstation.ps1 (PowerShell)

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\scripts\forensics-workstation.ps1
.\scripts\forensics-workstation.ps1 -AnalystName "Alice Johnson"
.\scripts\forensics-workstation.ps1 -Help
```

**Features:**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "forensics-workstation: command not found"
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Check permissions: `chmod +x scripts/forensics-workstation`
- Verify file exists: `ls -la scripts/forensics-workstation`

### PowerShell error "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"
```powershell
# Enable script execution (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### "coc-log: command not found"
- Only available INSIDE the forensic workstation
- Make sure you ran `./scripts/forensics-workstation` first
- Verify Docker image was rebuilt with: `docker compose build dfir`

### Docker image won't build
- Check Docker Desktop is running
- Clear cache: `docker compose build --no-cache dfir`
- Review error messages carefully (may be network issue)

---

## üìã Migration Guide

If you have old scripts using direct Docker commands:

**Old way:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm dfir fls -r /evidence/usb.img
```

**New way (recommended):**
```bash
./scripts/forensics-workstation
# Then inside:
analyst@forensics-lab:/cases$ fls -r /evidence/usb.img
analyst@forensics-lab:/cases$ coc-log "fls -r /evidence/usb.img" "listing"
```

**Benefits:**
- Immersive DFIR workstation experience
- Automatic chain of custody logging
- Analyst identification
- Better workflow consistency

## üîÑ For Script Maintenance

### Adding New Scripts

1. **Student-facing:** Keep in `scripts/` root directory
2. **Instructor-only:** Place in `scripts/instructor/`
3. **Legacy references:** Place in `scripts/legacy/`
4. **Always:** Include usage comments at top

### Deprecating Scripts

1. Move to `scripts/legacy/`
2. Update this README with deprecation note
3. Add comment in script explaining why deprecated
4. Keep for 1-2 semesters before deletion

### Testing Scripts

```bash
# Test on bash
bash scripts/forensics-workstation

# Test on PowerShell
pwsh scripts/forensics-workstation.ps1

# Verify setup
./scripts/verify_setup.sh
```

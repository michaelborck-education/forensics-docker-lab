## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Immersive Entry Experience** 🎭
Students no longer see Docker complexity:

**Before:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm dfir
```

**After:**
```bash
./scripts/forensics-workstation        # (or .ps1 on Windows)
# Analyst name prompt
# Professional banner
# Analyst name in prompt: alice@forensics-lab:/cases$
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Chain of Custody Logging** 📋
Automatic audit trail with `coc-log` command:

```bash
coc-log "fls -r /evidence/usb.img" "Initial filesystem listing"
```

**Automatically creates:**
- Timestamped CSV log entry
- SHA256 hash of output
- Saved output file
- Analyst name tracking
- Exit code recording

### 3. **Evidence Naming (Storyline Consistency)** 🔍
USB device now properly named:
- `disk.img` → `usb.img` ✅
- `disk.E01` → `usb.E01` ✅
- Updated across 30+ files

### 4. **Professional Script Organization** 🗂️
```
scripts/
├── forensics-workstation       ← Student (Mac/Linux)
├── forensics-workstation.ps1   ← Student (Windows)
├── coc-log                      ← Student (inside container)
├── verify_setup.sh              ← Student (verification)
├── instructor/                  ← Instructor tools
│   └── hashlog.py
└── legacy/                      ← Reference/old versions
    ├── make_practice_image*.sh
    └── convert_to_e01*.sh
```

### 5. **Instructor/Student Separation** 🔐
- Separate git branches (main vs instructor)
- All instructor materials in organized folders
- Clear README on instructor branch
- Protected from accidental student distribution

### 6. **Comprehensive Documentation** 📚
New guides created:
- **POLISH_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - What was done
- **POLISH_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - What's next
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - How to use new features
- **PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step for remaining work
- **scripts/README.md** - Script organization
- Updated main **README.md** - Immersive workflow featured

## 💡 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Two-tier CoC approach** (walkthrough optional, assignment required)
   - Students learn informally first time
   - Professional logging required for grades
   - Reduces initial cognitive load

2. **Separate immersive and Docker commands**
   - Recommended path hides complexity
   - Advanced path available for power users
   - Documentation shows both

3. **Instructor branch for separation**
   - Prevents accidental distribution of answers
   - Scalable for multi-instructor teams
   - Clear branching strategy

4. **Legacy folder instead of deletion**
   - Preserves history
   - References available if needed
   - Cleaner main scripts directory

5. **USB naming for evidence**
   - Aligns with 2009 Cloudcore scenario
   - Matches seized device narrative
   - Better student understanding

## 🎯 Next Steps (Your Turn)

### Immediate (Today)
1. Review PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
2. Test `./scripts/forensics-workstation` on your systems
3. Test `coc-log` inside container
4. Verify PowerShell version works on Windows

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Update Labs 2-4 READMEs (30 min)
2. Create Lab 5-6 walkthroughs (30 min)
3. Add CoC examples throughout (20 min)
4. Do consistency pass (10 min)

### Before Distribution
1. Test full workflow on fresh clone
2. Verify on Windows/Mac/Linux
3. Check instructor branch doesn't leak to students
4. Validate all links and references

## 🎓 Summary for Your Students

When you distribute this to students:

**"We've completely redesigned the lab experience to be more immersive and professional. Instead of complex Docker commands, you'll use a single script to enter the forensic workstation with your analyst name. We've also added comprehensive chain of custody logging that automatically tracks every command you run. This mimics real-world forensic investigations while teaching professional documentation practices."**

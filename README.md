## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Prerequisites

**Install Docker Desktop:**
- **Windows/Mac:** Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  # Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
  ```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

**System Requirements:**
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB+ recommended for Autopsy GUI)
- 15GB free disk space (for all evidence files)
- Internet connection (first build only)

### Step 2: Build the Forensic Environment

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd /path/to/forensics-docker-lab

# Build the main container (first time: ~2-5 minutes)
docker compose build

# Verify build succeeded
docker compose run --rm dfir echo "Environment ready!"
```

You should see the forensic lab banner!

### Step 3: Verify Your Setup (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```batch
scripts\verify_setup.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/verify_setup.sh
```

All checks should pass (✓ in green).

### Step 4: Enter the Immersive Forensic Workstation

**Mac/Linux/Windows WSL:**
```bash
./scripts/forensics-workstation
```

**Windows (Batch):**
```batch
scripts\forensics-workstation.bat
```

> **Note:** Batch script for Windows users (no PowerShell required).

You'll be prompted for your analyst name, then you're inside:
```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                 ║
║     DIGITAL FORENSICS & INCIDENT RESPONSE LABORATORY            ║
║                                                                 ║
║     Cloudcore 2009 Data Exfiltration Investigation              ║

╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

alice@forensics-lab:/cases$
```

**Now run forensic commands directly** (no `docker compose` prefix!):
```bash
# Example: List evidence files
ls -la /evidence/

# Example: Verify USB image integrity
sha256sum /evidence/usb.E01

# Example: Start Lab 1 analysis
mkdir -p USB_Imaging/output
cd USB_Imaging
fls -r /evidence/usb.img > output/fls.txt

# When done
exit
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ Immersive Forensic Workstation

Instead of typing `docker compose run --rm dfir` every time, use:
```bash
./scripts/forensics-workstation
```

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 Feels like connecting to a real DFIR workstation
- 📝 Your analyst name is logged in chain of custody
- ⚡ Less typing = faster workflow
- 🏢 Matches real-world incident response practice

### ✅ Automatic Chain of Custody Logging

The `coc-log` utility automatically timestamps and hashes all commands:
```bash
coc-log "fls -r /evidence/usb.img" "Initial filesystem analysis"
```

Results are logged to `cases/analysis_log.csv` with:
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Analyst name
- Command executed
- Exit code
- Output hash (SHA256)
- File size
- Your notes

### ✅ Complete Evidence Package

All evidence files are included:
- **usb.img / usb.E01** - USB device forensic image (800MB)
- **memory.raw** - Windows XP memory dump (511MB)
- **network.cap** - Network traffic capture (100MB)

Read-only to prevent accidental modification. All analysis happens in writable `./cases/` folders.

### ✅ Multi-Platform Support

- **Windows:** PowerShell scripts with Docker Desktop + WSL 2
- **macOS:** Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) support
- **Linux:** Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.

---

## 🖥️ Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows Users

**Terminal:** Use Windows Terminal with Command Prompt or PowerShell (both work)

**Docker Desktop Setup:**
- Enable WSL 2 backend (default)
- Allocate 4GB+ RAM in Docker Desktop settings
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running

**Commands:**
```batch
# Use batch scripts for Windows:
scripts\verify_setup.bat
scripts\forensics-workstation.bat

# Docker commands work the same:
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm dfir
```

**Common Issues:**
- "Command not found": Restart Docker Desktop
- "Access denied": Run Command Prompt as Administrator  
- Batch file won't run: Ensure you're in the correct directory
- PowerShell execution policy: Use batch files instead (no PowerShell required)

### macOS Users (Intel and Apple Silicon)

**Terminal:** Use built-in Terminal or iTerm2

**Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):**
- Docker uses Rosetta 2 (automatic translation)
- Performance is excellent
- First build may take 5-7 minutes

**Commands:**
```bash
./scripts/verify_setup.sh
./scripts/forensics-workstation
```

### Linux Users (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)

**Docker Group Setup (one-time):**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
groups | grep docker  # verify
```

**Commands:**
```bash
./scripts/verify_setup.sh
./scripts/forensics-workstation
```

## 💡 Essential Commands

### Starting Your Forensic Session

**Mac/Linux/WSL:**
```bash
# Enter the immersive workstation (RECOMMENDED)
./scripts/forensics-workstation

# Or use Docker directly (for advanced users)
docker compose run --rm -it dfir bash
```

**Windows:**
```batch
# Enter the immersive workstation (RECOMMENDED)
scripts\forensics-workstation.bat

# Or use Docker directly (for advanced users)
docker compose run --rm -it dfir bash
```

### Inside the Workstation

```bash
# Lab 1: Analyze the USB image
mkdir -p USB_Imaging/output
fls -r /evidence/usb.img > USB_Imaging/output/fls.txt

# Lab 2: Memory analysis (run on host, not inside workstation)
docker compose exec vol2 vol.py -f /evidence/memory.raw imageinfo

# Lab 5: Network analysis (run on host, not inside workstation)
tshark -r evidence/network.cap -Y "irc"

# Always exit when done
exit
```

### Chain of Custody

**Log commands for evidence handling:**
```bash
# Inside workstation
coc-log "fls -r /evidence/usb.img" "Lab 1 filesystem listing"

# This creates: cases/analysis_log.csv with timestamp, hash, analyst name
```

**See complete reference:** `docs/COMMANDS.md`

## 📁 Workspace Organization

### Evidence Directory (`./evidence/`)

**READ-ONLY** - Never modify:
- `usb.img` / `usb.E01` - USB device image
- `memory.raw` - Memory dump
- `network.cap` - Network capture

Mounted inside container as `/evidence`

### Cases Directory (`./cases/`)

**WRITABLE** - Save all your work:
- Mounted inside container as `/cases`
- Everything you create in `/cases/` appears in `./cases/` on your host
- One folder per lab (USB_Imaging, Memory_Forensics, etc.)

**Example structure:**
```
./cases/
├── USB_Imaging/
│   ├── README.md          ← Lab 1 instructions
│   ├── WALKTHROUGH.md     ← Step-by-step guide
│   ├── output/            ← Your analysis outputs
│   ├── recovered/         ← Recovered files
│   └── report.md          ← Your report (copy from templates/WORKBOOK.md)
├── Memory_Forensics/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── WALKTHROUGH.md
│   ├── vol_output/
│   └── report.md
└── [etc for other labs...]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Docker command not found"

**Fix:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running (Windows/Mac)
- Restart terminal after installing Docker
- Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

**Fix:**
- **Windows/Mac:** Start Docker Desktop application
- **Linux:** `sudo systemctl start docker`

### "Permission denied" on /evidence

**This is expected!** Evidence is read-only.
- ✅ Correct: `fls -r /evidence/usb.img > /cases/output.txt`
- ❌ Wrong: `fls -r /evidence/usb.img > /evidence/output.txt`

### "Build failed" or "Container won't start"

**Fix:**
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### "Port 8080 already in use" (if using Autopsy)

**Fix:** Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change `8080:8080` to `8081:8080`

### Getting More Help

- **Lab Session:** Ask instructor or TAs
- **Office Hours:** See course syllabus for times
- **LMS Forum:** Post technical questions
- **Documentation:** Review `docs/COMMANDS.md`, `docs/SCENARIO.md`, lab WALKTHROUGH.md

See **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** for more detailed troubleshooting.
